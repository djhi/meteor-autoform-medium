# 0.0.4
Switch to `mediumeditor:mediumeditor`, official package.
Added a template specific to materialize as using quickForm or quickField would
generate a label which does not play well with the editor.

# 0.0.3

Switch to `gildaspk:medium-editor` which does not include any medium-editor plugins
and does not inject any css apart from medium-editor.
